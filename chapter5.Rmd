#ANALYSIS

library(corrplot)
library(GGally)

#Show a graphical overview of the data and show summaries of the variables in the data. Describe and interpret the outputs, commenting on the distributions of the variables and the relationships between them.

ggpairs(human_)
cor(human_)

summary(human_)

#######From the correlation table, we can see several interesting dynamics between variables, such as a strong positive interrelation between expected years of schooling and Life Expectancy at Birth, or a clear positive correlation between Maternal Mortality Ratio and Adolescent Birth rate.


#Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the raw (non-standardized) human data. Show the variability captured by the principal components. Draw a biplot displaying the observations by the first two principal components (PC1 coordinate in x-axis, PC2 coordinate in y-axis), along with arrows representing the original variables

pca_human_ <- prcomp(human_)
biplot(pca_human_, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.9, 1), col = c("grey40", "deeppink2"))

#Standardize the variables in the human data and repeat the above analysis. Interpret the results of both analysis (with and without standardizing). 

human_std <- scale(human_)
human_std <- as.data.frame(human_std)

pca_human_std <- prcomp(human_std)
biplot(pca_human_std, choices = 1:2, cex = c(0.9, 1), col = c("grey40", "deeppink2"))

# The angle between the arrows can be interpreted as the correlation between the variables.
#The angle between a variable and a PC axis can be interpreted as the correlation between the two.
#The length of the arrows are proportional to the standard deviations of the variables.


##The results of the standardized and non standardized procedures are already quite distinct at first glance, with the countries being distributed much more homogeneously. Without standardizing, the GNI variable becomes the only visible variable and the countries become lumped at the top right corner.
##In the second graph we can appreciate much more the different groups of variables clustered together, such as the nmumber of females in parliamanet or the ratio M/f in the labour force. Lastly, on the right side we can see how Mother Mortality and Adolescent Birth ratios are placed also very close to each other.
##Seeing how each of the variables in those groups correlates with each other in the same cluster (looking at the angles) and the angle they have respective to the two components, we could attempt at labeling each of the two dimensions:
#The approach that I find most intersting would be labeling PC2 as Gender Equality and PC1 as Economic Equality, given that the variables grouped in each side could fit nicely with these desxcriptions, and it would also make sense of the country distribution along the graph.



##5. TEA TIME!

tea <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/Helsinki-Open-Data-Science/master/datasets/tea.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


str(tea)
dim(tea)



keep_columns <- c("Tea", "tea.time", "how", "sugar", "where", "lunch")
tea_time <- select(tea, keep_columns)

summary(tea_time)
str(tea_time)

library(ggplot2)
pivot_longer(tea, cols = c("Tea", "tea.time", "how", "sugar", "where", "lunch")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) + facet_wrap("name", scales = "free") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) + geom_bar()



library(FactoMineR)
mca <- MCA(tea_time, graph = FALSE)
summary(mca)

plot(mca, invisible=c("ind"), graph.type = "classic",  habillage = "quali")


#The MCA graph provides a great insight of how the different variables interact with the different underlying component dimensions.
#In the case of my sample of variables, tea.time, sugar and lunch seem to have reduced impact on the dimensions, while where and how appear to be much more linked to changes in the dimensions highlighted.





```
I am very happy with this chapter!! Despite some initial difficulties, I have found myself capable of following each step carefully and understand each part of the analysis. I have found MCA specially interesting and I think I will continue to work with it for my thesis project! Such a fantastic way of working with qualitative data in conjunction to qualitative analysis.
